**Note**:

I am not the original owner, only exported this code to Github. But I updated the pprof test code for the Go part to make it compile pass and can work to generate the perf data.

I updated code under `src/havlak/go` to make it work and suite for my test.

Tested pass on Go v1.5, on my Macbook Pro.
